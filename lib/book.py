"""The vehicle book: the odometer, and the record of what has been done to it.

Neither of these can be read off the bus.

**The odometer is not an OBD-II PID.** There is a service 01 PID 0xA6 in the
later standards and almost nothing implements it; python-obd does not even
carry a command for it. So the mileage on the dashboard is unavailable to any
generic scan tool, including the expensive ones, and anything that shows you
one either asked a manufacturer protocol or did what this does: took a reading
from you once and integrated distance from the wheels ever since.

That is honest and it is also accurate — speed integrated at one hertz tracks a
trip meter to well inside a percent — but it drifts if the daemon is not
running while you drive. So it is easy to correct, and it says when it was
last set.

**The service record is not on the car either.** Maintenance Minder lives in
the instrument cluster behind a manufacturer protocol. What is on the car is
the intervals, which are in the owner's handbook, and what has been done, which
is in your head or a folder in the glovebox. This puts both somewhere the tool
can count down from.
