"""The document library: receipts, registrations, citations, everything else.

WHY THIS BELONGS IN A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL.

A car's history is not only what its computers remember. It is the oil change
receipt in the glovebox, the registration renewal, the inspection certificate,
the parking citation, the warranty card for a part somebody fitted three years
ago. That paper is what a buyer asks for, what a warranty claim needs, and what
tells you whether the timing belt was actually done at 90,000 miles or just
written on a sticker.

It also gets lost, which is the point. OmaCar already knows the odometer, the
drives, the faults and the service schedule. Filing the paperwork against the
same vehicle record turns a folder of receipts into a history that can be
searched, totalled and handed over.

FILED AGAINST THE VEHICLE, NOT THE APPLICATION.

Documents live in the per-VIN database like everything else, so a garage of
several cars keeps them apart with no chance of a Fit's inspection certificate
appearing under the CR-Z. Selling a car should hand over its documents with it.

THE ORIGINAL FILE IS NEVER MODIFIED.

Whatever is extracted from a document -- a date, a vendor, an amount, an
odometer reading -- is stored ALONGSIDE it and never in place of it. Extraction
can be wrong; a scan of a receipt cannot. Anything derived is marked with where
it came from, so a total that looks wrong can be traced back to the page it was
read off.
