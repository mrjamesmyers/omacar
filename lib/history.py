"""Turning documents into a service history.

WHAT WAS MISSING.

The service book tracked only `last_km` and `last_at` per item — when the oil
was last changed, overwritten each time. That answers "am I due?" and cannot
answer "what has been done to this car", which is the question a buyer asks, a
warranty claim needs, and anybody deciding whether a 190,000-mile car has been
looked after. So this adds an append-only log alongside the schedule: the
schedule stays the fast answer, the log is the record.

WHY MATCHING IS THE DANGEROUS PART.

A receipt says "TIRE ROTATION" or "Rotate & balance 4 tires" or "R&B tires".
The book says "Tyre rotation". Joining those is the whole feature, and getting
it wrong writes a maintenance record that is false — a car that looks serviced
and is not. That is worse than no record at all, because a service history is
exactly the kind of document people later trust absolutely.

So nothing is written automatically on a guess:

  - An exact or synonym match is offered as `confident`.
  - A fuzzy match above the floor is offered as `likely`, with its score.
  - Anything weaker is offered as `unmatched`, showing the receipt's own words
    so a person can decide.

All three are PROPOSALS. Applying them is a separate, deliberate act, and every
entry records the document it came from — so a history entry that looks wrong
can be traced to the page it was read off, and withdrawn.
