// Fonts — the picker, and the three lines that apply one.
//
// WHY THIS IS A PICKER AND NOT A DECISION.
//
// The note back from the meetup was "more polished text — Inter or something".
// Setting Inter is a two-line change and it is the wrong answer, because the
// three places this tool gets read want different things: a laptop on a bench
// at arm's length, a phone held sideways under a bonnet, and a tablet bolted to
// a dashboard in sunlight. Nobody knows which font survives all three until
// they have looked at all three. So: a small set of honest stacks, and the one
// that wins is whichever one is still legible on the third screen.
//
// WHAT A CARD SHOWS, AND WHY IT IS NOT AN ALPHABET.
//
// A pangram in 24px proves a font has letters in it. It says nothing at all
// about whether a drive-mode readout is still readable at sixty, which is the
// only question this tool actually has about type. So every card renders the
// same four things the app really renders — a section heading, a sentence of
// its own prose, a speed at the size drive mode shows one, and a line of the
// small print — each at the size and weight app.css gives it. What you are
// comparing is the app, not a specimen sheet.
//
// AND WHAT IT SHOWS UNDERNEATH.
//
// The family each slot will REALLY render as, resolved on the server against
// fc-list. A picker that offers Inter on a machine without Inter, renders
// something else, and says nothing is a picker you stop believing after the
// first time you catch it. When a head family is missing the card says so and
// gives the pacman line that fixes it.
//
// THIS MODULE ALSO APPLIES THE CHOICE AT BOOT.
//
// Importing it applies whatever this browser last saw, synchronously, before
// anything paints — then asks the server and reconciles. The server is the
// truth, exactly as it is for themes and the drive layout: the font settled on
// at the kitchen table should be the font the dashboard is wearing, and
// localStorage alone would have made it per-browser on a tool deliberately
// used from three of them. The copy in localStorage exists only so the first
// paint is not a flash of the wrong font.
