// Replay — walk back through a drive you already took.
//
// The tool could already record: `samples` holds every reading at about 1 Hz,
// and trips segment them into drives. What it could not do was give any of that
// back. You could see a chart of the last twenty minutes and nothing else --
// no way to step to the moment a fault set, no way to read the exact values at
// that instant, no way to get the numbers out.
//
// That gap matters most for the thing this tool is for. An intermittent fault
// is by definition not happening while you look at it; the whole value is in
// the recording. So: pick a drive, scrub to the moment, read every channel at
// that instant, and export the span if you want to work on it elsewhere.
//
// WHAT THIS SCREEN USED TO BE, AND WHY IT IS NOT THAT ANY MORE.
//
// It was a slider, a row of numbers, and a 260px black rectangle. The
// rectangle was meant to be the graph: it handed `scope()` channels with no
// `get` on them, so charts.js threw on the first trace and every drive replayed
// as an empty axis. The numbers updated, so the bug looked like a design --
// "the graph is coming" -- for as long as nobody opened the console.
//
// The replacement is not a bug fix with a chart bolted on. A replay screen has
// one job: put ONE time axis under everything the car said, and let you move a
// single playhead along it. So the traces, the event markers, the instruments
// and the numbers are all fed by the same index into the same rows, and the
// only thing that moves when you scrub is a line and a dozen text nodes.
//
// THREE DECISIONS THAT ARE LOAD-BEARING ON A 2017 DUAL-CORE LAPTOP.
//
//   Two canvases, not one. The traces are expensive and never change while you
//   scrub; the playhead is cheap and changes sixteen times a second. Drawing
//   them on one canvas means redrawing every trace to move a line -- which is
//   what the old cursor did, on top of a scope() call, per tick. The base layer
//   is repainted only when the span, the channel selection or the width
//   changes. The overlay is a clearRect and one stroke.
//
//   Min/max buckets, not points. /api/history clamps at 20000 rows; a canvas is
//   about 900 CSS pixels wide. Stroking 20000 line segments to fill 900 columns
//   costs twenty times what it buys and LOSES the spikes -- a 200 ms misfire dip
//   lands between two drawn points and disappears. One bucket per pixel column
//   carrying the min and max of everything that fell in it is both cheaper and
//   more honest: a spike one sample wide still draws.
//
//   Structure once, values in place. The hub view used to rebuild itself four
//   times a second and visibly blinked. Everything here that changes with the
//   playhead -- gauges, chips, clock, slider -- is a node captured at build time
//   and written to by paintNow(). draw() runs when the SHAPE changes, never on
//   a tick.
//
// WHAT IS ON THE AXIS IS WHAT IS IN THE RECORD, AND NOTHING ELSE.
//
// The sample stream is records.SAMPLE_COLS: rpm, speed, load, throttle,
// coolant, intake, maf, stft, ltft, timing, lphk, eff. There is no battery
// voltage in it. The daemon does log volts -- in the dtclog jsonl files, at one
// reading every five minutes, alongside the module fault counts -- but that is
// a different stream at a different cadence with no API in front of it, and a
// voltage lane drawn from it would be four points across an hour pretending to
// be a trace. So there is no volts lane here, and if you want one the honest
// place to start is teaching the daemon to put CONTROL_MODULE_VOLTAGE in
// `samples`, not teaching this file to interpolate.
//
// For the same reason the channel list is filtered per span: a lane is drawn
// only when that span actually carries readings for it. An axis with nothing on
// it is a claim that the car was silent, which is not the same as the tool not
// having asked.
