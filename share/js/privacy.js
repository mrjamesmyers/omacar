// Privacy mode — for photographing the screen.
//
// A VIN identifies one vehicle and, through any number of public and
// commercial databases, its owner and its history. A registration plate does
// the same more directly. Both are on screen constantly and by design: the
// vehicle bar never lets the identity out of sight, precisely so nobody works
// on the wrong car.
//
// That is right in a workshop and wrong on the internet. Somebody
// photographing this app for a forum post, a bug report or social media is
// about to publish a permanent identifier for their own car, and the app is
// the reason it is in frame.
//
// WHY THIS REPLACES TEXT RATHER THAN BLURRING IT.
//
// A CSS blur is a rendering effect: the real string stays in the DOM, in the
// accessibility tree, and in any copy of the page. That is fine against a
// photograph and useless against a screen recording that catches a reflow, a
// "copy as text", or anybody who opens the inspector. Replacing the value
// means what is not shown is genuinely not there to be shown.
//
// WHY THE MASK IS OBVIOUS.
//
// The failure that matters is believing you are private when you are not, so
// the indicator is a visible pill in the vehicle bar rather than a subtle
// state. The second failure is believing you are exposed when you are not,
// which is why the masked form still looks like a field with a value rather
// than an empty space.

// serial number. Showing the WMI keeps the field recognisable as a VIN without

// they did not plan to take. A full seventeen-character VIN parked in the top
// bar is therefore published by default, which is the wrong default for a
// value whose whole purpose here is "am I looking at the right car".
//
// So the bar always masks the middle. The WMI still says Honda, the last four
// still tell two cars in one household apart, and the eight characters in
// between -- the ones that carry the serial and index a VIN lookup -- are not
// on screen. Privacy mode still collapses this to the WMI alone, and the full
// value is still one click away on the Now tab and in the garage.
